# Welcome to Speech to Speech Translator (v1.0)!

Speech to Speech Translator allows the user to translate from multiple languages to several options. The application uses IBM services to convert your voice to text, translate the text to another language, and then convert the translated text to speech using a voice you choose.
This application could be helpful when traveling. If you(A native English speaker) were to travel to a foreign country, and were unable to speak their language, you could have them speak into the application and hear what they say in plain english. Then, you could speak plain English into the application to reply back to the person.
